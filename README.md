# Unit Test Practice Calculator

This simple app will help you get some practice with unit testing and basic javascript. 

Add functionality by adding to the `public/javascripts/modules/calculator.mjs` file. 

You shouldn't need to update the HTML and CSS for this app, but feel free if you want to. The files are located in the `public` directory.

You can follow along with this guide to get the calculator working but always give it your best shot for each step before using the guide:
